# Project 3 - NYC Hotel Yelp Review Study

My problem is, New York City, is home to many tourist attractions, which means they are also a busy hub for hotels for tourists. I want to know whether or not using a select sample of reviews from hotels in New York City, is the overall opinion of what New York City hotels have to offer a positive or negative? What's the most commom wording in all reviews? My solution is to use the API to find all of the hotels in New York City, and go ahead and review each of the reviews. From there, I will go ahead and plot a donut chart of the selected sample of reviews and create a WordCloud of all of the reviews.

## Project Files

You can find 2 different project files in this GitHub Repository.
1. **yelp-fusion.ipynb** is the Jupyter Notebook file that is where I get the Yelp reviews with the Yelp Fusion API, where I conduct Sentiment Analysis, and create WordClouds of the reviews.
2. **Review.png** is a png image of my WordCloud.

## Setting up your Yelp Keys

You will need to create a Yelp Key and title it as `yelpkeys.py`.
